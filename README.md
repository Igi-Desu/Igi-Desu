<h2>ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Igor or you can call me Igi.<h2>
<p>As far as my memory go I was playing video games, or just surfing the internet, I really liked it back then and the only thing that changed since then, is that I want to develop games myself.<p>
<h2>
<p>I started making games using unity in 2020, it was more of a time killer than something serious. <p>
<small>It was until I've had to pick a project for a college course and man... What a boring projects there were there, rowing championship schedule? booring. Sudoku? Too simple. I thought to myself, "I need to make something interesting, something that will be a bit of a challenge.", so I came up with making PacMan in 3D. It was first project that wasn't just a simple jump, move right, left game, I had to came up with many ideas to make the game possible. It was a lot of fun, probably most fun I had while programming!<p>
  <h2>
<p>Now while I am making my new projects, I don't just make games work, I try my best to make code clean and flexible (spaghetti is no more[in most cases!]). I try to look for new techniques, that will make more interesting features possible.<p>
